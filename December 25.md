📅 December 25 – SQL Fundamentals
📌 Overview

Today I focused on understanding the foundations of SQL and how it is used to efficiently extract meaningful information from large datasets. This forms the backbone of data analysis, reporting, and analytics workflows used in real-world organizations.

🧠 Concepts Learned
1️⃣ What is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to interact with relational databases

Helps retrieve, insert, update, and manage data stored in tables

Enables working with large volumes of data efficiently

2️⃣ Types of SQL Languages

Learned the four major categories of SQL commands:

DQL (Data Query Language)

Used to retrieve data

Example: SELECT

DDL (Data Definition Language)

Used to define or modify database structures

Examples: CREATE, ALTER, DROP

DML (Data Manipulation Language)

Used to insert, update, or delete data

Examples: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

DCL (Data Control Language)

Used to control access and permissions

Examples: GRANT, REVOKE

3️⃣ Why SQL Queries Matter

Databases can contain millions of rows

SQL queries allow us to:

Extract only relevant subsets of data

Filter, sort, and aggregate information

Answer business questions quickly and accurately

SQL acts as a bridge between raw data and actionable insights.

🎯 Key Takeaway

Understanding SQL basics is essential for:

Data analysis

Dashboard creation

Backend data handling

Analytics and applied data science roles

This knowledge is foundational for working with real-world datasets in professional environments.
